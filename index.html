        If you are interested in running for a seat on the PF HOA Board of Directors, you can download an  application form here. 
        
        The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board of Directors, along with help from many other committee volunteers.  The Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is responsible for using the money assessed to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs which are of value to Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing the value of the neighborhood.  If you have 1-2 hours a month to donate to the neighborhood, you are encouraged to run one of the 3 upcoming vacancies on the Board for a term which begins January 1, 2018 and runs through December 31, 2019.  Applications must be submitted by November 10. 
        
        This year, voting will be conducted electronically.  You can opt for paper ballots by dropping a note in the HOA dropbox.  Homeowners must be a member in good standing to vote in the election, and not owe the association more than $10.   You can access the past due list by clicking here.

        Planning 
        We will be planning at the next HOA Board meeting at Carrie Busey Elementary on Monday, November 14th at 8pm. If you'd like to help out in any capacity of the planning please attend. 
        
        Treat Tables - If you'd like to host, please e-mail  <a href="mailto:board@prairefieldshoa.com"><span style="color:#ff9c00;">board@prairiefieldshoa.com</span></a>
        We will be looking for folks to provide and monitor the treat tables/voting stations. Each table will be given $30 to purchase the treats. We would like to focus on having these tables stationed at corners throughout the neighborhood to make it easy for visitors to find. This year we are looking to have ballot style voting sheets that people can carry with them as they look at the houses. 
        
        PRIZES! 
        As was the case last year, there will be trophies for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Place as well as honorable mention ribbons. We will also have a fun prize for one random participating house!
